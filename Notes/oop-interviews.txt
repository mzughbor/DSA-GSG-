- python multiple inhiertance vs. java single inheritance [so need interface to do this]
- abstract vs. interface [interface just abstract method to override it later in children classes [no implementation]]

What is OOP ?
it's a techinech to write clean code readable, maintable code thats achieved by applaying classes and objects basically, ... 

we doing that through using four pillers - concepts ...

1- Inheritanc : it's a way that allow you to have the features from the parent class to reuse code by extending classes.

2- Abstraction : it's a process to hide complex detilas and showing only essential features.

3- Polymorphism : the ability of objects to take on many forms for the same intity so, respond to the same interface differently.

4- Encapsulation : the concept of restricting direct access to some components - like wrapper to protect the inner data. 

----

Types of Polymorphism:
Compile-time (Method Overloading): Not supported in Python directly, can be mimicked. by using deafult and args* ...
Runtime (Method Overriding): Supported through inheritance with the abstraction ABC ...

What is abstract class ?
it's a class cannot be instantiated directly and any subclass inheriting from an abstract class must implement all its abstract methods.

--
What is an interface ?
An interface defines a contract (a set of methods) that implementing classes must follow. Interfaces are used to specify what a class must do, but not how it does it.
